title: Who Am I?

<script src="/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js"></script>


<p>My names Brady Lamson, I’m a Statistical Science major / Computer Science minor at MSU Denver. Previously I acquired my Associates Degree of Science - Psychology from the Community College of Denver. In my academic life I keep myself busy as a member of the MSU Denver Honors Program and am also an officer of the MSU Statistical Science club. In my personal time I dive deep into obscure retro video games and bizarre movies! I hope to become good enough at what I do to become a Data Scientist in the future.</p>
<p>I hope that as I progress as a student and acquire a deeper understanding of the world I can use that growth to finally give back and contribute to it. Data sets are oftentimes a window into a world I otherwise would never have access to, and that makes them incredibly satisfying to explore and dig into. I want to become an expert at navigating these spaces, to be able to share the stories hidden in the data with everyone. I never to want to stop learning, to stop being being challenged. I know that data science can help me meet those goals.</p>
<p>I hope that didn’t get too serious! Since starting this journey it’s felt like I’ve been drinking from a fire hose. As such I’ve collected experience in a variety of areas. You could say I have an approximate knowledge of many things. To give an idea of where I’m at I’ve listed said many things below.</p>
