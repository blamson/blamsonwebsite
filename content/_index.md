Welcome to my personal website! This is a work-in-progress place for me to host everything I'm working on. I'm a student currently so this is *mostly* classwork at the moment but I intend to keep this bad boy running and improving as time goes on. That isn't to say that this website isn't already great though, I have put a lot of work into it. There are two important places to check out. 

- The [**blog**](/post/) section is where I host most of my homework assignments. That isn't its only purpose though as I intend to put more interesting stuff there over time. I recently did a [write-up](/2021-12-28-fire-emblem-random-number-showcase/) about the video game franchise Fire Emblem and how the listed probabilities in those games are often lying to you. I had a lot of fun with it and I want to write more content like that in the future, especially as I progress in my statistics degree.

- The [**homework pdfs**](/homework/) section hosts all of my homework that isn't as easy to natively get working on the site. That's where all of my work done purely in LaTex is hosted. Did you know that it was the first programming language I ever learned? What a nightmarish place to start! Definitely check this out if you want to see how good you can make math homework look when you get a handle on it.

I hope you enjoy your little perusal of the site. If you're curious about me specifically check the [**about me**](/about/) section. Take care!
